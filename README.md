# cozy-linshare

## What is it

cozy-linshare is a container app that embeds [LinShare](https://github.com/linagora/linshare) app. It is a very basic app displaying the cozy-bar and an iframe. By leveraging [cozy-external-bridge](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-libs/tree/master/packages/cozy-external-bridge), it allows history syncing from LinShare and exposes APIs to LinShare.

## Install

You can then clone the app repository and install dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-linshare.git
$ cd cozy-linshare
$ yarn install
```
